Gizmodo mapped and analyzed one year’s worth of flight data from seven of the 10 Predators in CBP’s fleet. The data, obtained through Tampa-based flight tracking company RadarBox, reveals that since June of 2019, these seven drones have completed more than 150 flights—patrolling the southern and northern borders, zig-zagging over politically active indigenous lands, and circling the skies over cities small and large—some of them far outside the U.S.  Here is some code we used for the analysis

### Code
Map.earth-engine.js is the code that runs in Google Earth Engine
Utils/* - everything required to parse and clean the data.
